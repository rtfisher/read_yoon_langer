======

(*) Need to introduce differential elements for mu and r when the indices
    i or j are zero. 

(*) Angular momentum integrations are substantially off from reported global quantities, possibly due in part to previous issue.

(*) Gravitational energy involves a factor of 1/2?

(*) Some discrepancies in the reported value of w0 compared with table data.
