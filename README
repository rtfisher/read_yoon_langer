## Read Yoon and Langer (2005) plotfiles. Models are computed via the
##  self-consistent field method according to a specific angular 
##  momentum accretion model. Models are stored on a 2D spherical
##  mesh in mu = cos theta and spherical radius r, nth x nr in extent,
##  in the upper-half plane (0 >= mu >= 1).
##
## Furthermore, the model density, angular velocity, and potentials
##  are stored in a dimensionless fashion. The dimensionless variables
##  (here noted as primed variables) are defined as 
##
##     r ' = r / rmax
##     rho' = rho / rhomax
##     w'   = w / sqrt (G * rhomax)
##     psi' = psi / (G * rmax**2. * rhomax)
##     phi' = phi / (G * rmax**2. * rhomax)
##
## We rescale all quantities to obtain physical variables after readin.
##
## The file format was described in a private e-mail communication
##  from Yoon, see yoon_langer_2005_format.txt file.
##
## Full details of their models are described in their 2005 A&A paper,
##  doi:10.1051/0004-6361:20042542.

Issues, rtf 010720
==================

(*) Pressure virial term appears to represent PV instead of 3 PV 

(*) Gravitational energy involves a factor of 1/2?

(*) Some discrepancies in the reported value of w0 compared with table data.
