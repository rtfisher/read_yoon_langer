Yoon & Langer (2005, A&A, 436, 967--985) generated rotating equilibrium white dwarf models. We contacted Prof. Langer and obtained a large number of 2D axisymmetric datasets. Please contact Professor Fisher for the models (models.tar.gz). The following describes the format of the datasets (Quoted from Sung-Chul):

You may find directories like 1d8, 2d8, ... 1d10. These numbers denote the central density
of the models. In each directory, you may also find subdirectories like
AAa and rigid. Rigid means rigid-body rotation models, while AA* means differentially 
rotating models at a given central density (AA* sequences in the paper).

"plot*" files contain detailed information of the models. See below for the data structure.

I used spherical coordinate: r & mu = cos(theta).

All the details about the numerical methods for constructing models are
described in Yoon & Langer, 2005, A&A, 436, 967--985.

The grid is set as the following:

     ! Coordinates -----------------------------------------------
      do i=1,nth
        mu(i) = (i-1.d0)/(nth - 1.0d0) ! cos(th)
      enddo
      do j=1,nr
        x(j) = 16.*(j-1.d0)/(nr-1.0)/15.0
      enddo

where nth = 149, and nr = 149 are used.

The output format in each file is as the following:

      open(17,file=outname(nopen), status='replace')
      write(17,220) nth, nr, nmd
      write(17,221) rmax,mtot,rhomax,tw,jtot,egrav,erot,pi3,
&              temp,frhocrit,w0,ws,bfit
      do i = 1,nth
      do j = 1, nr
        write(17,222) rho(i,j), w(i,j),psi(i,j), phi(i,j)
      enddo
      enddo
 220  format(1x,i3, 1x, i3, 1x, i1)
 221  format(13(1x,d20.9))
 222  format(4(1x,d20.9))
      close(17)

where:

nth : number of grid in mu
nr  : number of grid in r
nmd : Ignore this

rmax  : equatorial radius
mtot  : total mass
rhomax        : maximum density
tw      : T/W -- ratio of the rotational energy to the gravitational energy
jtot    : total angular momentum
egrav   : gravitational energy
erot    : rotational energy
pi3     : volume integration of pressure times 3
temp    : you can ignore this.
frhocrit: 'parameter 'f_p' in the paper
w0      : central angular velocity
ws      : surface angular velocity
bfit    : parameter 'a' in the paper

rho(i,j) = rho(mu,r) : density
w(i,j)  = Omega(mu,r): angular velocity
Psi(i,j) = Psi(mu,r) : total potential
Phi(i,j) = Phi(mu,r) : gravitaional potential


Here, rho(i,j), w(i,j), Psi(i,j) and Phi(i,j) are scaled with the basis
as described in the paper. So, they are dimensionless quantities. In order
to convert them into dimensional ones, you need to multiply the basis, as
the following (see the paper).

rho = rho * rhomax
w = w * sqrt(G*rhomax)
Psi = Psi * G * Rmax^2 * rhomax
Phi = Phi * G * Rmax^2 * rhomax
Note: The dimensionless radial coordinate must be scaled by multiplying by rmax.
